# Django-URL_Shortening_service

This is a project in which I have designed a Django URL shortening service. 

This URL_Shortener will Shorten your URL and redirects you to that particular URL. It will handle the actual URLs and shorten it.

## Technologies used in this project is:

--Django Framework (version 1.10): a powerful backend framework used by top sites like Instagram and Pinterest. Django makes it easier to have a powerful web application to use  for all types of projects. Django is written in Python (and is one of the most popular Python libraries in the world).

-- Bootstrap (version 3.3): a powerful front-end framework used by thousands of sites around the world. Bootstrap makes it easier to have a responsive web application so it looks awesome on any mobile device and any desktop computer.

-- Python 3: One of the top programming languages in the world. Powerful enough for the experts, easy enough for beginners. Why? It uses spaces and line breaks with minimal special characters (like !@#$;*) which means it's closer to English than most programming languages. 

This is the part of course which I've done on Udemy Platform
